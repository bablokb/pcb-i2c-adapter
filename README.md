pcb-i2c-adapter
===============

This is a small PCB mapping various I2C pin combinations to a Grove connector.

Useful to connect all kinds of I2C-breakouts using Grove. Since every
breakout uses it's own pin-order, the PCB supports eight different
variations (additionally the Pi-variant: with 
pins 1 (3V3), 3 (SDA), 5 (SCL), 7 (nc), 9 (GND)).
